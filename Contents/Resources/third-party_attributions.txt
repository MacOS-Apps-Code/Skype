libarchive 2.8.5 

The libarchive distribution as a whole is Copyright by Tim Kientzle 
and is subject to the copyright notice reproduced at the bottom of 
this file. 

Each individual file in this distribution should have a clear 
copyright/licensing statement at the beginning of the file. If any do 
not, please let me know and I will rectify it. The following is 
intended to summarize the copyright status of the individual files; 
the actual statements in the files are controlling. 

* Except as listed below, all C sources (including .c and .h files) 
  and documentation files are subject to the copyright notice reproduced 
  at the bottom of this file. 

* The following source files are also subject in whole or in part to 
  a 3-clause UC Regents copyright; please read the individual source 
  files for details: 
   libarchive/archive_entry.c 
   libarchive/archive_read_support_compression_compress.c 
   libarchive/archive_write_set_compression_compress.c 
   libarchive/mtree.5 
   tar/matching.c 

* The following source files are in the public domain: 
   tar/getdate.c 

* The build files---including Makefiles, configure scripts, 
  and auxiliary scripts used as part of the compile process---have 
  widely varying licensing terms. Please check individual files before 
  distributing them to see if those restrictions apply to you. 

I intend for all new source code to use the license below and hope over 
time to replace code with other licenses with new implementations that 
do use the license below. The varying licensing of the build scripts 
seems to be an unavoidable mess.

To All Licensees, Distributors of Any Version of BSD: 

As you know, certain of the Berkeley Software Distribution ("BSD") source 
code files require that further distributions of products containing all or 
portions of the software, acknowledge within their advertising materials 
that such products contain software developed by UC Berkeley and its

      * must display the following acknowledgement: 
      * This product includes software developed by the University of 
      * California, Berkeley and its contributors." 

Effective immediately, licensees and distributors are no longer required to 
include the acknowledgement within advertising materials. Accordingly, the 
foregoing paragraph of those BSD Unix files containing it is hereby deleted
